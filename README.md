## Activity 2.4: Building and running the docker image locally 

Make sure to run in virtual environment like Flask in previous activity, go to root repo directory of local computer.

## Activity 2.4: Step 3 Build & Run
 *First activate virtual env:*
 
 python3 -m venv .venv   
. .venv/bin/activate 

*Build:*

docker build -t tasfia:final .
 
![](Screenshots/A2_4step3a.png)

*Run:*

docker run -p 5001:5000 tasfia:final

## Activity 2.4: Step 4 Application Run Website & Docker Application on Local Computer

Application running (Go to Docker Desktop application on local computer & click port):

*If port 5000:*

http://localhost:5000/

*If port 5001:*

http://localhost:5001/

CAREFUL: do this command only after you CTRL+C and exit but it's okay if you still stay in venv. To show the containers currently running, used <docker ps â€“a>, then saw the log information indicating the running application. 

docker ps -a
